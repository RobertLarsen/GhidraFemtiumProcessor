Welcome to the Hacker Academy applicant evaluation test.

NB: This test represents a substantial part of the applicant assessment. Give it
    your best effort.

1) Be sure to read the entire file BURNAFTERREADING.md.

2) Be extra sure you've read the section "Deliverables", which describes what
   material you should send in.

3) Solve this task in any way that you see fit, as long as it could be deployed
   in a realistic scenario! Creativity is encouraged - just keep in mind that
   the solution must be able to apply to a real-world scenario.

4) No matter if you've solved 5% or 110% of this scenario, be sure to document
   the parts you have, and send us your solution. We don't expect everybody to
   solve 100% of this test.

   That's why we have the academy, after all.

5) See point 2.

Good luck!
